# Overview

Planner is a front-end for GitLab, GitHub, and Jira that makes it significantly faster for teams to create, estimate, and manage tickets.  

It incorporates over a decade of agile software management learnings, to increase both velocity and collaboration for teams.

Merge requests can also be explored, with statistics on response time and a view that encourages faster code review turnaround times.

Planner is distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md) and is designed to be self-hosted on your organization's own infrastructure.

# Customizing

To customize for your organization, please edit the constants in:

- `src/data/customize.ts`

For deployment to Google Cloud, you will need to update the project ID marked `XX` in:

- `script/setup/1-gcp.sh`

And update the domain name marked `companyname` in:

- `script/setup/kube-certificate.yml`
- `script/setup/kube-ingress.yml`

<br>

# Deploying the 1st Time

This project is currently designed for deployment using Google Cloud and Kubernetes:

- Create a project in Google Cloud and write down the ID
- Make sure Kubernetes, Container API, and Compute API are enabled
- Go to terminal locally and `cd script/setup`
- Add the project ID and run `./1-gcp.sh`
- Add the domain name to the .yml files and run `./2-kube.sh`
- This script will return an IP.  You can also use `kubectl get ingress` to get the IP address anytime.
- Go to the DNS provider and link the domain name to this IP

# Setting up OAuth 

## GitLab OAuth Setup

To setup OAuth for GitLab:

- Go to your user Preferences in GitLab, and then select Applications.  
- Add a new Application in GitLab with a redirect URI of `https://planner.companyname.com`
- Copy the clientID and paste in `src/data/customize.ts` under `production`
- Add a second Application in GitLab with a redirect URI of `http://localhost:3000` for local development
- Copy the clientID and paste in `src/data/customize.ts` under `development`

## Jira OAuth Setup

To setup OAuth for Jira:

- Go to [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/)
- Create a new OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app
- Add redirect URIs for both development (`http://localhost:3001/api/jira/callback`) and production (`https://planner.companyname.com/api/jira/callback`)
- Copy the client ID and paste in `src/data/customize.ts` under both `development` and `production`
- Store the client secret securely as an environment variable (`JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET`) on your server

# GitLab API Integration

Planner was built to use GitLab's new GraphQL API... but it has some missing functionality for mutations, so we still need to use REST calls to modify data.

All API calls require an authorization token in the HTTP header of form `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.  This token can either be retrieved using OAuth, or by getting a personal access token from GitLab.   

For local development, you can create an Application in GitLab and point it to `http://localhost:3000` to test OAuth locally, or you can use a personal access token (instructions are provided in the app).

# API Integrations

## GitLab API

Planner uses GitLab's GraphQL API for querying data and REST API for mutations.

All API calls require an authorization token in the HTTP header of form `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. This token can either be retrieved using OAuth, or by getting a personal access token from GitLab.

## GitHub API

Pull request viewing was supported for GitHub in a prior version of the Planner app. This version is still available in the `github-tickets-only` branch, which will show tickets from GitLab and pull requests from GitHub.

## Jira API

Planner integrates with Jira's REST API through a server-side proxy to handle the OAuth 2.0 code flow requirements. This integration provides similar functionality to the GitLab integration, allowing you to manage Jira issues through the same interface.

Planner includes the following legal and policy documents:

- [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) - Details how Planner handles user data
- [Terms of License](docs/TERMS_OF_LICENSE.md) - Explains the MIT License terms and usage guidelines

These documents are provided as templates and should be reviewed and customized by each organization deploying Planner.

# App History

## 2020

This app was created by Pete DeLaurentis in his personal time over the course of a few weekends in 2020, and was subsequently adopted by Pete's team and several other teams at his then-employer, PicnicHealth.  

## 2021

Planner is officially published as an open source project, with his employer's blessing.  

## 2022

Pete continues to maintain the app in his spare time, including updates to make sure it continues to work with the latest version of GitLab.

## 2025

Jira integration was added to Planner, expanding its capabilities to support multiple ticket management systems through a common interface.
